  - No, I feel like these exercises were a good introduction to the class.

### Accessibility

This section was pretty simple, most of what it covered was already covered in the HTML section. I have been surprised by how simple and generally pleasant adding accessibility features is. I was initially worried it would be a lot of extra work!

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
  - Yes, I was able to complete the exercises just using material we went over during class.
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
  - There was just one exercise in this section, and I found it quite helpful. I think it's interesting using HTML semantics to make forms navigable.
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
  - I think accessibility is one of the strongest aspects of this class. Everything was explained well
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  - I think this section could benefit from an exercise involving keyboard navigation or something.

### CSS

This section was enjoyable, particularly using the selectors to manipulate elements. I like trying to get my desired look with fewer manipulations.
The most striking exercise was the position one. I felt a sense of dread working with the positions. I feel like if you're not intentional about this sort of thing, you might end up with a layout that's really easy to break and difficult to fix.

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
  - I was able to complete the exercises on my own, mostly. I used the solutions for a few of the exercises.
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
  - I think this is an extremely helpful set of exercises. I liked how there were a lot of them and I like that you get a few angles at solving problems here. The wide variety of selectors means you really want to be intentional with how you're using them
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  - I'm not sure how much of this there is in CSS but it would have been nice to learn about more media queries. The screen size queries seem extremely useful and it would have been fun to learn even more.

### Flexbox

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
  - Yes, In particular, that one game we played early in the term where you have to select the plates and pickles and such things was really helpful when it came to learning this material.
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
  - I found this exercise helpful. I think most websites I can imagine making are likely to use flex boxes in some capacity.
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
  - I wish we would look under the hood for flexbox so that I can understand what it's trying to do. I think if I could get a good mental model of what the flexbox creators had in mind it would help me deal with the flexboxes more intuitively.
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  I found it difficult to remember how flex-flow worked and ended up getting stuck because of that.

### Grid

I found this assignment delightful! There was a moment at the end where I realized how I could use media queries to really succinctly make a dynamic layout using just the css grid. I found this extremely satisfying.

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
  - I was able to complete the assignments with just a bit of looking at the solutions. I find the grid
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
  - Nothing. The grids are pretty easy.
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  - I would like to see a really hard grid problem at the end.

### Javascript

Javascript in general is fun but async stuff is tough for me. I had to consult the literature a lot on this one.

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
  - These ones are pretty tough. I had to consult the docs for quite a few of them, though I'm not sure where that falls on the continuum here.
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
  - These exercises are awesome. The fetch and dom exercises in particular really highlight how powerful of a rendering engine the browser and how practical Javascript is. I definitely intend to go deeper on Javascript.
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
  - I don't think the reduce exercise is a great application of that function.
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  - I think more DOM manipulation would always be welcome.
