## Reflection Document

### HTML

I have messed around with html in the past, so this was a bit of a refresher. I enjoyed messing around with the different objects. The form was fun to work with, as I haven't really touched on those much.

### Accessibility

This section was pretty simple, most of what it covered was already covered in the HTML section. I have been surprised by how simple and generally pleasant adding accessibility features is. I was initially worried it would be a lot of extra work!

### CSS

This section was enjoyable, particularly using the selectors to manipulate elements. I like trying to get my desired look with fewer manipulations.

The most striking exercise was the position one. I felt a sense of dread working with the positions. I feel like if you're not intentional about this sort of thing, you might end up with a layout that's really easy to break and difficult to fix.
